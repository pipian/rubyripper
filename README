1. INTRODUCTION

Rubyripper aims to deliver high quality rips from audio cd's to your computer
drive. It tries to do so by ripping the same track with cdparanoia multiple
times and then comparing the results. It currently has a gtk2 and a command-
line interface.

Some of it's main features:
* graphical (gtk2) and command line interface
* a secure rip method -> see 2. SECURE RIP METHOD
* editable freedb tag fetching
* flac, vorbis, mp3, wav support
* any other codec by passing the command
* multiple codec encoding in one run
* offset support
* pass parameters to cdparanoia
* playlist creation
* logfile with analysis of corrected and impossible to correct positions
* MD5sum for each track included in the logfile


2. SECURE RIP METHOD

The underlying philosophy is that errors are random and therefore will differ
with each trial. Since the files don't always match directly proves that at
least part of this is true. However, it might be that some read errors are not
random and will happen exactly the same with multiple trials. In this case an
error would slip through unnoticed.

A completely secure rip can never be guaranteed, neither by Exact Audio Copy
(which inspired Rubyripper), nor by any other ripper. Factors like the
quality of the audio-cd and the quality of the cdrom drive are very important
as well. Despite these problems Rubyripper tries to do it's very best.

The user can set a number of 'A' matches for each chunk of 1000 bytes. Each
chunk represents about 0,006 seconds. If, after ripping the track 'A' times,
there are chunks that don't match 'A' times, another trial is launched. This
time however, the mismatched chunks must match 'B' times, which can be equal,
but not smaller to 'A' times.

When Rubyripper has finished the ripping process, a suspicious positions
analysis will be added to the logfile. For each second in the file it will
be shown how much mismatched chunks there were originally. And at which trial
these were corrected or not at all.

It's possible to set a limit to the number of times a track is ripped. For some
tracks it seems impossible to ever get a correct rip. The amount of errors left
are usually very small though. It's not likely one actually will be able to
hear this.


3. HOW TO INSTALL

Dependencies:
* cdparanoia
* ruby

Suggested:
* ruby-gettext (for translations)
* ruby-gtk2 (for gtk2 gui)
* cd-discid or discid (for proper freedb support)
* eject or diskutil for MacOS (for eject support)
* flac, oggenc, lame (if the codec is wanted)
* wavgain, vorbisgain, mp3gain (for replaygain support)
* normalize (for normalize support)

Run from directory:
(1) ./rubyripper_gtk2.rb or
(1) ./rubyripper_cli.rb

To install:
(1) ./configure --enable-lang-all --enable-gtk2 --enable-cli --prefix=/usr or
(1) ./configure --enable-lang=de,hu --enable-gtk2 --enable-cli --prefix=/usr
(2) make install
The executables will be named `rrip_cli` and `rrip_gui`

To uninstall: (1) `make uninstall`
To cleanup: (1) `make clean`

3a) MACOS SUPPORT

The CLI now works in MacOS. However, if your cdparanoia version
doesn't support the -d switch (to set the device), only the default
drive can be used. Rubyripper doesn't do this for you, so if you got
weird results with freedb fetching, use your other cdrom drive.

A cdparanoia port for MacOS that supports the -d switch can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=158413

For MacOS on x86 systems cd-discid is not working (ppc does), but discid is:
website => http://discid.sourceforge.net/
You can also test the fallback code for creating the discid ourselves,
but it may not work on audio-cd's with a data track.

5. FAQ

Q : Why does the last track go slower than the rest?
A : Chances are that you've supplied an offset different than 0 and supplied the
option -Z to cdparanoia. A cdparanoia bug prevents finishing ripping the last
track if -Z is supplied, so it's automatically removed for the last track.

Q : Will Rubyripper work on any platform other than linux?
A : If the same dependencies are available on these platforms, then things will
probably just work fine. If some of the dependencies are missing, but you do
know one other utility which does just about the same, please report a
feature request at the Google bugtracker.

Q : How do I report a bug / request a missing feature?
A : Go to http://code.google.com/p/rubyripper/issues/list. The Rubyripper
developer will typically respond within one week. You can add your e-mail,
so any changes or updates in the bug will be send to you.

Q : How do I get the very latest code (I don't care how many bugs there are)?
A : Using git. See the wiki for instructions.

Q : My buttons don't react and give the following error in a terminal:
warning: GRClosure invoking callback: already destroyed Callback error
A : Upgrade your ruby gtk bindings to a >=0.16.* version.

Q: How can I help translate rubyripper to my language?
A: See the wiki for instructions
